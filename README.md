# BRUTAL REALITY CHECK

Right now your repo will host **only code**.

If you want this project to be *professional-grade* for recruiters / production, you should also add:

- Unit tests  
- Data caching (don’t download on every callback)  
- Config for multiple timeframes  
- Logging  
- Docs

If you want help adding any of those, tell me which one first.

If you hit any errors during the Git push, paste them exactly and I’ll fix them step-by-step.
